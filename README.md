# TalkAboutSeries

Have you ever wanted to talk about a new tv series you just watched, but you have no one to talk to? No problem!

This python app allows you to talk to a bot about a tv series (for now it is only able to have a very limited conversation about 'Friends')

# Set it up

1/ Run train.py and wait for the training to be over

2/ Run chat.py and use the graphic interface 

# How to use it

1/ Write your text 

2/ Click submit or enter 

3/ Wait for the chatbot to reply!

4/ If you want to exit, you can either tell the robot you want to exit or quit and he will exit automatically (he will understand thanks to deep learning and training) or you can close the graphical interface
